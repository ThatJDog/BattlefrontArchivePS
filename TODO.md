## Bugs
- Season teams wrong (bottom player is with next team)
- Round and series summaries dont add up (maybe rounds doesn't do subs but series does? prob not actually)

## Features to Add
- Match Merging (Draws and Rehosts)
- Use Sub Matches toggle (To preven sub matches for elo for example)
- Ranking algorithm
    - Rank Leaderboard
    - Possibly Rank-Based Elo
- Record Book
- Team Stats
- General Stats (Maps, Regions, Gamemodes)
- Player Profile
    - Enhance Profile stats for more information
- Add season prize pools and winners
- Add player cards over each season

- Cards
    - Try creating them with html and css
    - If it is too slow reduce card resolution and use the images
